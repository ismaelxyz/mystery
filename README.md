# Mystery
A game in the early stage of development.

## How to play?
If you want to try something new, running these commands is enough:
```bash
# You should clone or download this repo first!
git clone ...
cd mystery/
# Create a venv environment is highly recommended
python3 -m venv .
source bin/active
# Download dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Then run the game
python3 -m mystery
```

# Build releases
Exectuable files are generated by `build-release`:
```bash
# Generate a mystery.pyz file
./build-release pyz

# Generate an executable file
# (Linux) It needs a specific version of PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller==5.13.2
./build-release exec
```

The reason why we must use an older version of PyInstaller now is shown [here](https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet/issues/1049).

## 中文繁简转换
为减少**开发前期**的工作量，各繁体中文的本地化翻译都默认由简体中文通过`opencc`转换而成，如有错误请谅解。
